""" BOILERPLATE EXPERIMENT.
A boilerplate to create your own experiments, and make use of the
_base_expyriment class as part of a battery of cognitive tasks for expyriment.

Documentation on developing can be found here:
<https://mbroedl.github.io/cognitive-tasks-for-expyriment/howto/developing/>

To run it, you need to have a working copy of python 2.7 or
greater, and expyriment (e.g. via pip) 0.7, 0.9, or greater.

If you use this experiment for any publications, please make
sure to cite the authors as explained in the repository:
